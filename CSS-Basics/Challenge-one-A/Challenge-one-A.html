      <h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18</h1>
      <p class="p1">
         This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced
         in the film Dead Poets <br> Society and gave names to the band The
         Darling Buds and the book and television series <br> The Darling Buds
         of May. Read it and weep!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span>S</span>hall I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
        <li><span>T</span>hou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
        <li><span>R</span>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
        <li><span>A</span>nd summer's lease hath all too short a date:</li>
        <li><span>S</span>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
        <li><span>A</span>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</li>
        <li><span>A</span>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
        <li><span>B</span>y chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</li>
        <li><span>B</span>ut thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
        <li><span>N</span>or lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
        <li><span>N</span>or shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</li>
        <li><span>W</span>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</li>
        <li><span>S</span>o long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</li>
        <li><span>S</span>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
